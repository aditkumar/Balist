Get a bucket of chicken for the table.1,FALSE,The Palm,"Nice steakhouse, but best part is private rooms in the back. Make sure to ask for the ""Southwest"" room."1,FALSE,Perry's,Amazing steakhouse. Very high-end atmosphere and food. Highly suggest the turtle soup and the pork chop.1,FALSE,The Velvet Taco,"Gourmet tacos (yes, those exist.) Pretty good, especially with their hotsauce. They also have some beers and a decent outdoor area."1,FALSE,Nonna,Awesome Italian. Tough to get in so call a couple days in advance. Highly recommend their pastas and cocktails.1,FALSE,Bob's,"Nice steakhouse but lacking the atmosphere of Perry's or the privacy of The Palm back rooms. Still, absolutely awesome meat here."1,FALSE,Smoke,Great high-end BBQ place. If it's on the menu get the Coffee Braised Brisket - it's a game-changer.1,FALSE,Meddlesome Moth,"Cool place, really big on small plates. A little chaotic with a big group - everyone is clamoring for stuff. Better with 2-6 people."1,FALSE,Deep Sushi,Great little sushi spot in Deep Ellum (close to downtown). Not super high-end decor-wise but great service and tasty sushi. Patio is wonderful on a nice evening.1,FALSE,Serious Pizza,Good place to go for a slice and a beer. In Deep Ellum so close to downtown. Have some TVs to watch games.1,FALSE,Oak,"Nice place. Very modern (in ""design district""). Pricey, but food is fantastic."1,FALSE,Twisted Root Burger,Pretty cool burger place in Deep Ellum. Very casual. Get the sweet potato chips.1,FALSE,Hopdoddy,Awesome burger place. Delicious burgers and AMAZING beer selection. Some TVs around but definitely not a sports bar. Can't recommend enough.1,FALSE,Hibiscus,Really nice high-end place. Grab a cocktail at the bar before sitting down - the bartenders are really knowledgable and will make you some samples if you're nice.1,FALSE,Canne Roso,"Gourmet pizzas. Food was great but not a lot of variety, so tough to order a bunch of interesting pizzas for the group. Best for groups of 2-4 I would say."1,FALSE,Chesterfield's,"Great little cocktail spot. They were undergoing a ""transition"" between chefs when I went though so the food was a bit underwhelming."
